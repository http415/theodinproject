    <p>Takeout-style broccoli with garlic sauce is a great dish to have with any meal. Served with some white or brown rice, it’s tasty and guilt-free, and it’s easier than you’d think to emulate that restaurant flavor!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Broccoli</li>
        <li>Dark soy sauce</li>
        <li>Soy sauce</li>
        <li>Rice wine vinegar</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Chicken or vegetable stock</li>
        <li>Sesame oil</li>
        <li>Ground white pepper</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Minced garlic</li>
        <li>Shoaxing wine</li>
        <li>Cornstarch</li>
        <li>Homemade chili oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the broccoli, mix the soy sauces, rice wine vinegar, sugar, stock, sesame oil, and ground white pepper then set aside</li>
        <li>Heat the wok over high heat. Ad the vegetable oil, garlic, and broccoli. Quickly stir-fry so the garlic doesn't burn</li>
        <li>Stir fry for 15 seconds, and the shaoxing rice wine around the perimeter of the wok. Give everything a quick stir fry and add in the sauce mixture. Let the sauce come to a boil, mix the cornstarch and water together. Turn the heat down slightly and cook the broccoli a bit longer before adding the cornstarch slurry if you like your broccoli softer</li>
        <li>Add the cornstarch while stirring the broccoli and sauce constantly. Let the sauce cool and thicken until it coats the back of a spoon. If you like a thick sauce, and more cornstarch and water, if you like it thinner, add less. Stir in the optional chili oil at this point and serve!</li>
    </ol>
